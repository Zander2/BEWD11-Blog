Alex,

Great job! All the pieces are there and the application is working. I think this definitely showcases what you learned in the course thus far. Awesome job implementing the search functionality as well!

Here are a couple of comments:

1. While working with resources it's important to follow the naming conventions for views. Using `render` will work fine in the controller, but the convention exists to make it clear to other developers later on.

2. Your views contain HTML that should be in the layout file (application.html.erb). Things like the `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.
